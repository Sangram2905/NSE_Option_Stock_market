Risk profiles of put option buyer and seller
Buying a put option gives you the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at the given strike price, within a specific time period. 
Therefore a put option payoff at expiration depends on where the underlying price is relative to the put option strike price.

In this notebook, we will plot a put buyer's and a put seller's payoff graph for a 900 strike price put on the Infosys stock.

"""
Put payoff
We define a function put_payoff that calculates the payoff from buying a put option. 
The function takes sT(Stock price range) which is a range of possible values of the stock price at expiration, 
the strike price of the put option and the premium of the put option as input.

It returns a numpy array containing the profit from put option for different stock prices. 
When the stock price is less than the strike price, the profit is measured as the difference 
between strike price and stock price, and when the stock price is greater than the strike price 
then the profit is zero. 
After this, a put premium is deducted from the Profit-n-Lose(pnl) to compute the payoff.


Coding guide
np.where can be used to create put payoff structure. The syntax of it is as follows:

payoff_array = np.where(condition, true_value, false_value)

If the condition is true then the payoff_array is assigned true_value else false_value.

The condition, true and false value for put payoff from buyer's perspective can be as follows:

condition: sT < strike_price
true_value: strike_price - sT
false_value: 0

"""
def put_payoff (sT, strike_price, premium):
    pnl = np.where(sT<strike_price, strike_price - sT, 0)
    return pnl - premium

"""
Define parameters
We will define the spot price, 
the strike price, premium, and a range of possible values for the Infosys stock price at expiry.
"""
# Infosys stock price
spot_price = 900

# Put strike price and cost
strike_price = 900
premium = 20

# Stock price range at the expiration of the put
# We have defined range for the stock price at expiry as +/- 10% from spot price
# Syntax: numpy.arange(start price, stop price)
sT = np.arange(0.9*spot_price,1.1*spot_price)


## Put option buyer payoff

payoff_long_put = put_payoff(sT, strike_price, premium)
# Plot the graph
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,5))
ax.spines['bottom'].set_position('zero')
ax.plot(sT,payoff_long_put,label='Put option buyer payoff')
plt.xlabel('Infosys Stock Price')
plt.ylabel('Profit and loss')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

"""
So what do you observe?

Even if the price of Infosys goes above the strike price of 900, 
the maximum loss seems to be just INR 20/-. 
Therefore, the loss to the put option buyer is restricted to the extent of the premium he has paid.

The profit from this put option seems to increase linearly as and 
when Infosys starts to move below the strike price of 900. 

Therefore, the lower the spot price goes, the higher will be the profit.

Though the put option is supposed to make a profit when the spot price moves below the strike price, 
the put option buyer first needs to recover the premium he has paid.

From the above points, we can say that the buyer of the put option has limited risk and the potential 
to make a huge profit.
"""


##Put option seller payoff
"""
To get the payoff graph for option seller, 
we have multiplied the payoff of option buyer by -1.0, 
as the option buyer makes the profit, 
the option seller will lose the exact same amount and vice-versa.

"""

payoff_short_put = payoff_long_put * -1.0
# Plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,5))
ax.spines['bottom'].set_position('zero')
ax.plot(sT,payoff_short_put,label='Put option seller payoff',color='r')
plt.xlabel('Infosys Stock Price')
plt.ylabel('Profit and loss')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

"""
The put option seller payoff looks like a mirror image of the put option buyer payoff.

The profit is restricted to INR 20/- as long as the spot price is trading at any price above the strike price of 900.
From 900 to 880, we can see the profits getting reduced.
Below 880, the put option seller starts losing money. The losses increase with a decrease in stock price.
Therefore, you sell a put option only when your view is that the underlying asset will not fall beyond the strike price.

##########################  PUT Exercise ############################

"""
Letâ€™s assume that the stock Tata Motors is trading at INR 430. We bought 430 strike put for INR 3. In this exercise, we will learn to calculate the payoff from the put option.

For a put buyer at the option expiry:
      A. If the stock price is less than the strike price, then the put buyer profits the difference.
      B. If the stock price is greater than the strike price, then the put buyer loses the premium.
To enter into this payoff structure the put buyer pays a premium to the put seller.

######################### Computing Historical Volatility ###########

"""
Computing Historical Volatility
In this notebook, we will be computing the 20 trading days (or 1 month) historical volatility for the time period starting from 20th April, 2016 to 13th April, 2018. Historical Volatility gauges the fluctuations of underlying securities by measuring the price changes over a predetermined period of time in the past.

Import the libraries
First, we will import the necessary libraries.

Volatility helps us understand how much an asset is expected to move in a particular duration. It is a good indicator of risk in an investment. Volatility is measured by standard deviation of log returns for an asset. In this exercise, you will be computing the 20-day historical volatility using the log returns, following which the standard deviation will be computed.

Syntax:
DataFrame.rolling(window=n).std()

Parameter
window: number of observations used to calculate the statistics.

Instructions

We have already calculated the log returns of the adjusted closing price and stored in the data['Log Returns'].

You need to write only one line of code.

Create a column called 20 day Historical Volatility in the data dataframe and assign the following to it.

Call the rolling() function on data['Log Returns']
Pass the value 20 as the parameter to the rolling() function
Call the std() function
And multiply the whole with 100
